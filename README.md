# Digital Stewards Training Program
## 48% of the world does not have a connection to the internet.  
## How can this change?  
One theory is the creation of community networks led by local organizations, stakeholders and citizens who take control of their own data infrastructure; thus allowing for less reliance on the telcom providers.

This Digital Stewards training program is developed by SayCel Technologies in order to train local stakeholders, adults, youth, and students how to create, manage and maintain local based communications networks, with a special focus on emergency and cultural resilience.  

In this class you learn how to create your own communications networks. We will cover the software, and hardware used today in community based networks, as well as DIY infrastructure solutions. We will also delve into the business internet, wifi and fiber networks. Participants should be ready to work heard, and develop their technolgy based job skills in one of the fastest growing and most important industries in the world: the internet.
